Develop Android apps with Kotlin
--------------------------------


Write better Android apps faster with Kotlin.
Kotlin is a modern statically typed programming language used by 
over 60% of professional Android developers that helps boost productivity, 
developer satisfaction, and code safety. 

----------------------
Expressive and concise
----------------------
Kotlin's modern language features allow you to focus on expressing
your ideas and write less boilerplate code. 

------------
Safer code 
-----------
 With @Nullable and @NonNull included in its type system, Kotlin helps you avoid NullPointerExceptions.
 Android apps that use Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash.

------------
Interoperable
-------------
Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language,
so you can have as little or as much of Kotlin in your project as you want.

----------------------
Structured concurrency
-----------------------
Kotlin coroutines streamline asynchronous programming,
making common tasks like network calls and database updates simple and performant. 

--------------------------------
Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers
--------------------------------
In the Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers course, you learn the basics of Kotlin as you create various small programs in IntelliJ IDEA.

The course materials include course codelabs with suggested homework assignments.

You'll get the most value out of this course if you work through the lessons in sequence, 
but it's not a requirement. Depending on your knowledge, you may be able to skim some sections.

--------------------
Lesson 1: Get started
----------------------
In Lesson 1, you learn how to work with the Kotlin REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interactive shell, and you practice using the basic syntax of Kotlin code.

-----------------------
Lesson 2: Kotlin basics
------------------------
In Lesson 2, you learn how to use Kotlin data types, operators,
and variables, and how to work with booleans and conditions.
You explore the difference between nullable and non-nullable variables, and you practice using arrays, lists, and loops in Kotlin.

------------------
Lesson 3: Functions
-------------------
In Lesson 3, you learn how to create a program with a main() function and arguments in IntelliJ IDEA.
You create small programs as you learn about default values, compact functions, list filters, basic lambdas, and higher-order functions.

----------------------------
Lesson 4: Classes and objects
-----------------------------
In Lesson 4, you learn about classes, objects,
and inheritance in Kotlin. You create small programs as you learn about abstract classes, interfaces, and interface delegation.

----------------------
Lesson 5.1: Extensions
---------------------
In Lesson 5.1, you learn about collections, constants, and extension functions in Kotlin.
You create small programs as you learn about pairs, triples, lists, and hash maps for storing data,
and implement extension functions to add functionality to existing classes.

---------------------
Lesson 5.2: Generics
----------------------
In Lesson 5.2, you learn about generic classes, methods, and functions in Kotlin. 
You create a type hierarchy, make classes more flexible by making them generic,
and extend their functionality with generic methods and functions.

--------------------------------
Lesson 6: Functional manipulation
---------------------------------
In Lesson 6, you learn about annotations, labeled breaks, and Single Abstract Methods (SAMs).
You also review lambdas and higher-order functions.
You then create and use lambdas and higher-order functions, and learn about higher-order functions in the Kotlin Standard Library.
